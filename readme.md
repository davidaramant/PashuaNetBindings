* Some enums are not consistent (numbers vs strings)
* Comparison of double?
* Slapping on "Control" at the end of the class name (could possibly using ActualName thing)
* Base class needed?
* Magic to parse output
* Stuff like X/Y that aren't required but don't have a default
* Validation of properties when writing
